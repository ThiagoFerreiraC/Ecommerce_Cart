# Ecommerce_Cart

This project is based on a an assignment given at the back-end java course offered by Ada Tech in partnership with Sinqia. Its aim is to put into to practice OOP concepts that were taught, such as interfaces and the SOLID principles, as well as collections, such as maps and lists.

The program should, through the console, allow a user to select a product from a hard coded list and add it to a shopping cart.
